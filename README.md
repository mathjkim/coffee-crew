"Coffee Trading Trend Analysis" We analyze historical data on the global coffee trade from the [International Coffee Organization (ICO)](https://www.ico.org/new_historical.asp) and the [Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations](https://www.fao.org). We make an interactive dashboard presenting production, consumption, exports, imports, and price for different countries and years.
